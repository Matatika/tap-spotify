## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

Name | Required | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`client_id` | Yes |  | Your `tap-spotify` app client ID
`client_secret` | Yes | | Your `tap-spotify` app client secret
`refresh_token` | Yes | | Your `tap-spotify` app refresh token

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-spotify --about
```

### Source Authentication and Authorization

Before using `tap-spotify`, you will need to create an [app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps) from your [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). We recommend restricting your use of this app to `tap-spotify` only. Provide an name, description and a redirect URI of `https://alecchen.dev/spotify-refresh-token` (explained below).

#### Get a Refresh Token
Use [this web app](https://alecchen.dev/spotify-refresh-token?scope=user-top-read) made by [Alec Chen](https://alecchen.dev/) to get a refresh token with your Spotify app credentials:
- Provide your app client ID and secret in the appropriate fields
- Click 'Submit' and follow the Spotify login flow
- Copy the refresh token

The following token scopes are required (and are pre-selected for you when following the above web app link):
- [`user-top-read`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes#user-top-read)

If a required scope is not set, `tap-spotify` will encounter a `403 Forbidden` response from the Spotify Web API and fail. You must set all required scopes.

Some scopes are not required. Setting these will allow `tap-spotify` to read more specific and possibly sensitive resource data, so do this at your own risk.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-spotify` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-spotify --version
tap-spotify --help
tap-spotify --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
make init
```

### Lint your Code

Identify lint issues by running:

```bash
make lint
```

> If `make init` has been run, this command will execute automatically before a commit

You can also fix lint issues automatically with:

```bash
make lint-fix
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_spotify/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
make test
```

You can also test the `tap-spotify` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-spotify --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-spotify
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-spotify --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-spotify target-jsonl
```

### SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to
develop your own taps and targets.
